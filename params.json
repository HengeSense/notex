However, reStructuredText is also very much suitable for other kind of texts.\r\n\r\n### Tutorial\r\nThere are many good primers, tutorials and references about RST, e.g. [RST Primer](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/rest.html) is quite a thorough introduction and [Quick ReStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html) is a good quick reference.\r\n\r\n### Miscellanea\r\nNoTex' front-end has entirely been written with the [ExtJS](http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs3) JavaScript and the back-end with the [http://www.djangoproject.com](Django) Python library. The back-end applies the Python document generator [Sphinx](http://sphinx.pocoo.org) to translate the RST input files to the various target formats. \r\n\r\n***\r\n[**Launch NoTex**](http://notex.ch) will start the application.\r\n***","google":"UA-6838945-7","tagline":"A reStructuredText editor"}
