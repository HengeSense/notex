Notex Editor
============

This editor helps you to write reports using the lightweight markup language *reStructuredText* aka *reST*. Once you've written your report, it can easily be translated to various formats like HTML, LaTex and PDF.

It's features are:

  * HTML, LaTex and PDF generation using the Sphinx and LaTex backend, and
  * Import and export of reports from/to local/remote storage.

It's major benefit is that it saves the time and effort to install and setup the very powerful *Sphinx* and *LaTex* tools. Using a simple UI and a beautiful markup language it enables to write state-of-art reports.
