Practical examples
==================

Einstein used the :index:`CGS system` of units (centimeters, grams, seconds, dynes, and ergs), but the formula is independent of the system of units. In :index:`natural units`, the :index:`speed of light` is defined to equal 1, and the formula expresses an identity: :math:`E = m`. In the :index:`SI system` (expressing the ratio :math:`E / m` in joules per kilogram using the value of |c| in meters per second):

.. math::

   E / m = c^2 &= (299,792,458\ m/s)^2 \\
               &= 89,875,517,873,681,764\ J/kg \\
              (&\approx 9.0 \times 1016\ joules\ per\ kilogram)

So the energy equivalent of one gram of mass is equivalent to:

 | 89.9 terajoules
 | 25.0 million kilowatt-hours (|≈| 25 GW·h)
 | 21.5 billion kilocalories (|≈| 21 Tcal) [#f13]_
 | 85.2 billion BTUs [#f13]_

or to the energy released by combustion of the following:

 | 21.5 kilotons of TNT-equivalent energy (|≈| 21 kt) [#f13]_
 | 568,000 US gallons of automotive gasoline

Any time energy is generated, the process can be evaluated from an |E=mc²| perspective. For instance, the "Gadget"-style bomb used in the Trinity test and the bombing of :index:`Nagasaki` had an explosive yield equivalent to 21 kt of TNT. About 1 kg of the approximately 6.15 kg of plutonium in each of these bombs fissioned into lighter elements totaling almost exactly one gram less, after cooling. [The electromagnetic radiation and kinetic energy (thermal and blast energy) released in this explosion carried the missing one gram of mass.] [#f14]_ This occurs because nuclear binding energy is released whenever elements with more than 62 nucleons fission.

Another example is :index:`hydroelectric generation`. The electrical energy produced by :index:`Grand Coulee Dam`'s turbines every 3.7 hours represents one gram of mass. This mass passes to the electrical devices (such as lights in cities) which are powered by the generators, where it appears as a gram of heat and light. [#f15]_ Turbine designers look at their equations in terms of pressure, torque, and RPM. However, Einstein's equations show that all energy has mass, and thus the electrical energy produced by a dam's generators, and the heat and light which result from it, all retain their mass, which is equivalent to the energy. The potential energy—and equivalent mass—represented by the waters of the :index:`Columbia River` as it descends to the :index:`Pacific Ocean` would be converted to heat due to viscous friction and the turbulence of white water rapids and waterfalls were it not for the dam and its generators. This heat would remain as mass on site at the water, were it not for the equipment which converted some of this potential and kinetic energy into electrical energy, which can be moved from place to place (taking mass with it).

Whenever energy is added to a system, the system gains mass.

* A :index:`spring's mass` increases whenever it is put into compression or tension. Its added mass arises from the added potential energy stored within it, which is bound in the stretched chemical (electron) bonds linking the atoms within the spring.

* Raising the temperature of an object (increasing its :index:`heat energy`) increases its mass. For example, consider the world's primary mass standard for the kilogram, made of platinum/iridium. If its temperature is allowed to change by 1 °C, its mass will change by 1.5 picograms (1 pg = 1 × 10\ :sup:`-12` g). [#f16]_

* A :index:`spinning ball` will weigh more than a ball that is not spinning. Its increase of mass is exactly the equivalent of the mass of energy of rotation, which is itself the sum of the kinetic energies of all the moving parts of the ball. For example, the :index:`Earth` itself is more massive due to its daily :index:`rotation`, than it would be with no rotation. This rotational energy (2.14 × 10\ :sup:`29` J) represents 2.38 billion metric tons of added mass. [#f17]_

Note that no net mass or energy is really created or lost in any of these examples and scenarios. Mass/energy simply moves from one place to another. These are some examples of the *transfer* of energy and mass in accordance with the *principle of mass–energy conservation*.

Note further that in accordance with Einstein's :index:`Strong Equivalence Principle` (:index:`SEP`), all forms of mass *and energy* produce a gravitational field in the same way. [#f18]_ So all radiated and transmitted energy *retains* its mass. Not only does the matter comprising Earth create gravity, but the gravitational field itself has mass, and that mass contributes to the field too. This effect is accounted for in ultra-precise laser ranging to the Moon as the Earth orbits the Sun when testing Einstein's general theory of relativity. [#f18]_

According to |E=mc²|, no :index:`closed system` (any system treated and observed as a whole) ever loses mass, even when rest mass is converted to energy. All types of energy contribute to mass, including potential energies. In relativity, interaction potentials are always due to :index:`local fields`, not to direct :index:`nonlocal interactions`, because signals cannot travel faster than light. The field energy is stored in field gradients or, in some cases (for massive fields), where the field has a nonzero value. The mass associated with the :index:`potential energy` is the mass–energy of the field energy. The mass associated with :index:`field energy` can be detected, in principle, by gravitational experiments, by checking how the field attracts other objects gravitationally. [#f19]_

The energy in the :index:`gravitational field` itself has some differences from other energies. There are several consistent ways to define the location of the energy in a gravitational field, all of which agree on the total energy when space is mostly flat and empty. But because the gravitational field can be made to vanish locally at any point by choosing a free-falling frame, the precise location of the energy becomes dependent on the observer's frame of reference, and thus has no exact location, even though it exists somewhere for any given observer. In the limit for low field strengths, this gravitational field energy is the familiar :index:`Newtonian gravitational potential energy`.
