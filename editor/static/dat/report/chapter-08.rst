History
=======

While Einstein was the first to have correctly deduced the mass-energy equivalence formula, he was not the first to have related energy with mass. But nearly all previous authors thought that the energy which contributes to mass comes only from electromagnetic fields. [#f30]_ [#f31]_ [#f32]_ [#f33]_

Newton: matter and light
========================

In 1717 :index:`Isaac Newton` speculated that light particles and matter particles were inter-convertible in "Query 30" of the *Opticks*, where he asks:

   Are not the gross bodies and light convertible into one another, and may not bodies receive much of their activity from the particles of light which enter their composition?

Electromagnetic mass
====================

There were many attempts in the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century—like those of :index:`J.J. Thomson` (1881), :index:`Oliver Heaviside` (1888), and :index:`George Frederick Charles Searle` (1897), :index:`Wilhelm Wien` (1900), :index:`Max Abraham` (1902), :index:`Hendrik Antoon Lorentz` (1904) — to understand as to how the mass of a charged object depends on the electrostatic field. [#f30]_ [#f31]_ This concept was called :index:`electromagnetic mass`, and was considered as being dependent on velocity and direction as well. Lorentz (1904) gave the following expressions for longitudinal and transverse electromagnetic mass:

.. math::

   m_L = \frac{m_0}{\left(\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}\right)^3},\ 
   m_T = \frac{m_0}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}},

where

.. math::

   m_0 = \frac{E_{em}}{c^2}.

Radiation pressure and inertia
==============================

Another way of deriving some sort of electromagnetic mass was based on the concept of :index:`radiation pressure`. In 1900, :index:`Henri Poincaré` associated electromagnetic radiation energy with a "fictitious fluid" having momentum and mass :math:`m_{em} = E_{em}/c^2`. By that, Poincaré tried to save the center of mass theorem in Lorentz's theory, though his treatment led to radiation paradoxes. [#f33]_

:index:`Friedrich Hasenöhrl` showed in 1904, that electromagnetic cavity radiation contributes the "apparent mass" :math:`m_0 = \frac{4}{3} \frac{E_{em}}{c^2}` to the cavity's mass. He argued that this implies mass dependence on temperature as well. [#f34]_

Einstein: mass-energy equivalence
=================================

Albert Einstein did not formulate exactly the formula |E=mc²| in his 1905 Annus Mirabilis paper "Does the Inertia of a Body Depend Upon Its Energy Content?"; [#f01]_ rather, the paper states that if a body gives off the energy :math:`L` in the form of radiation, its mass diminishes by :math:`L/c^2`. (Here, "radiation" means electromagnetic radiation, or light, and mass means the ordinary Newtonian mass of a slow-moving object.) This formulation relates only a change :math:`\Delta{m}` in mass to a change :math:`L` in energy without requiring the absolute relationship.

Objects with zero mass presumably have zero energy, so the extension that all mass is proportional to energy is obvious from this result. In 1905, even the hypothesis that changes in energy are accompanied by changes in mass was untested. Not until the discovery of the first type of antimatter (the positron in 1932) was it found that all of the mass of pairs of resting particles could be converted to radiation.

First derivation (1905)
-----------------------

Already in his relativity paper "On the electrodynamics of moving bodies", Einstein derived the correct expression for the kinetic energy of particles:

.. math::

   E_k = mc^2 \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} - 1\right).

Now the question remained open as to which formulation applies to bodies at rest. This was tackled by Einstein in his paper "Does the inertia of a body depend upon its energy content?". Einstein used a body emitting two light pulses in opposite directions, having energies of :math:`E_0` before and :math:`E_1` after the emission as seen in its rest frame. As seen from a moving frame, this becomes :math:`H_0` and :math:`H_1`. Einstein obtained:

.. math::

   (H_0-E_0) - (H_1-E_1) = E \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} - 1\right)

then he argued that :math:`H-E` can only differ from the kinetic energy :math:`K` by an additive constant, which gives

.. math::

   K_0 - K_1 = E \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} - 1\right).

Neglecting effects higher than third order in :math:`v/c` this gives:

.. math::

   K_0 - K_1 = \frac{E}{c^2} \frac{v^2}{2}.

Thus Einstein concluded that the emission reduces the body's mass by :math:`E/c^2` , and that the mass of a body is a measure of its energy content.

The correctness of Einstein's 1905 derivation of |E=mc²| was criticized by :index:`Max Planck` (1907), who argued that it is only valid to first approximation. Another criticism was formulated by :index:`Herbert Ives` (1952) and :index:`Max Jammer` (1961), asserting that Einstein's derivation is based on begging the question. [#f35]_ [#f36]_ On the other hand, :index:`John Stachel` and :index:`Roberto Torretti` (1982) argued that Ives' criticism was wrong, and that Einstein's derivation was correct. [#f37]_ :index:`Hans Ohanian` (2008) agreed with Stachel/Torretti's criticism of Ives, though he argued that Einstein's derivation was wrong for other reasons. [#f38]_ For a recent review, see :index:`Hecht` (2011). [#f39]_

Alternative version
-------------------

An alternative version of Einstein's thought experiment was proposed by :index:`Fritz Rohrlich` (1990), who based his reasoning on the :index:`Doppler effect`. [#f40]_ Like Einstein, he considered a body at rest with mass :math:`M`. If the body is examined in a frame moving with non-relativistic velocity |v|, it is no longer at rest and in the moving frame it has momentum :math:`P = Mv`. Then he supposed the body emits two pulses of light to the left and to the right, each carrying an equal amount of energy :math:`E/2`. In its rest frame, the object remains at rest after the emission since the two beams are equal in strength and carry opposite momentum.

But if the same process is considered in a frame moving with velocity |v| to the left, the pulse moving to the left will be red-shifted while the pulse moving to the right will be blue shifted. The blue light carries more momentum than the red light, so that the momentum of the light in the moving frame is not balanced: the light is carrying some net momentum to the right.

The object has not changed its velocity before or after the emission. Yet in this frame it has lost some right-momentum to the light. The only way it could have lost momentum is by losing mass. This also solves Poincaré's radiation paradox, discussed above.

The velocity is small, so the right-moving light is blue-shifted by an amount equal to the non-relativistic Doppler shift factor :math:`1 - v/c`. The momentum of the light is its energy divided by |c|, and it is increased by a factor of :math:`v/c`. So the right-moving light is carrying an extra momentum |ΔP| given by:

.. math::

   \Delta{P} = \frac{v}{c} \frac{E}{2c}.

The left-moving light carries a little less momentum, by the same amount |ΔP|. So the total right-momentum in the light is twice |ΔP|. This is the right-momentum that the object lost:

.. math::

   2 \Delta{P} = v \frac{E}{c^2}.

The momentum of the object in the moving frame after the emission is reduced by this amount:

.. math::

   P' = Mv-2\Delta{P} = \left(M-\frac{E}{c^2}\right)v.

So the change in the object's mass is equal to the total energy lost divided by |c²|. Since any emission of energy can be carried out by a two step process, where first the energy is emitted as light and then the light is converted to some other form of energy, any emission of energy is accompanied by a loss of mass. Similarly, by considering absorption, a gain in energy is accompanied by a gain in mass.

Relativistic center-of-mass theorem - 1906
------------------------------------------

Like Poincaré, Einstein concluded in 1906 that the inertia of electromagnetic energy is a necessary condition for the :index:`center-of-mass theorem` to hold. On this occasion, Einstein referred to Poincaré's 1900 paper and wrote: [#f41]_

   Although the merely formal considerations, which we will need for the proof, are already mostly contained in a work by H. Poincaré, for the sake of clarity I will not rely on that work. [#f42]_

In Einstein's more physical, as opposed to formal or mathematical, point of view, there was no need for fictitious masses. He could avoid the perpetuum mobile problem, because on the basis of the mass-energy equivalence he could show that the transport of inertia which accompanies the emission and absorption of radiation solves the problem. Poincaré's rejection of the principle of action-reaction can be avoided through Einstein's |E=mc²|, because mass conservation appears as a special case of the energy conservation law.

Others
======

During the nineteenth century there were several speculative attempts to show that mass and energy were proportional in various ether theories. [#f43]_ In 1873 :index:`Nikolay Umov` pointed out a relation between mass and energy for ether in the form of :math:`E = k \cdot mc^2`, where :math:`0.5 \leq k \leq 1`. [#f44]_ The writings of :index:`Samuel Tolver Preston`, [#f45]_ [#f46]_ and a 1903 paper by :index:`Olinto De Pretto`, [#f47]_ [#f48]_ presented a mass-energy relation. De Pretto's paper received recent press coverage when :index:`Umberto Bartocci` discovered that there were only three degrees of separation linking De Pretto to Einstein, leading Bartocci to conclude that Einstein was probably aware of De Pretto's work. [#f49]_

Preston and De Pretto, following :index:`Le Sage`, imagined that the universe was filled with an ether of tiny particles which are always moving at speed |c|. Each of these particles have a kinetic energy of :math:`mc^2` up to a small numerical factor. The non-relativistic kinetic energy formula did not always include the traditional factor of :math:`1/2`, since :index:`Leibniz` introduced kinetic energy without it, and the :math:`1/2` is largely conventional in pre-relativistic physics. [#f50]_ By assuming that every particle has a mass which is the sum of the masses of the ether particles, the authors would conclude that all matter contains an amount of kinetic energy either given by |E=mc²| or :math:`2E = mc^2` depending on the convention. A particle ether was usually considered unacceptably speculative science at the time, [#f51]_ and since these authors did not formulate relativity, their reasoning is completely different from that of Einstein, who used relativity to change frames.

Independently, :index:`Gustave Le Bon` in 1905 speculated that atoms could release large amounts of latent energy, reasoning from an all-encompassing qualitative philosophy of physics. [#f52]_ [#f53]_

Radioactivity and nuclear energy
================================

It was quickly noted after the discovery of radioactivity in 1897, that the total energy due to radioactive processes is about *one million times* greater than that involved in any known molecular change. However, it raised the question where this energy is coming from. After eliminating the idea of absorption and emission of some sort of Lesagian ether particles, the existence of a huge amount of latent energy, stored within matter, was proposed by :index:`Ernest Rutherford` and :index:`Frederick Soddy` in 1903. Rutherford also suggested that this internal energy is stored within normal matter as well. He went on to speculate in 1904: [#f54]_ [#f55]_

   If it were ever found possible to control at will the rate of disintegration of the radio-elements, an enormous amount of energy could be obtained from a small quantity of matter.

Einstein's equation is in no way an explanation of the large energies released in radioactive decay (this comes from the powerful nuclear forces involved; forces that were still unknown in 1905). In any case, the enormous energy released from radioactive decay (which had been measured by Rutherford) was much more easily measured than the (still small) change in the gross mass of materials, as a result. Einstein's equation, by theory, can give these energies by measuring mass differences before and after reactions, but in practice, these mass differences in 1905 were still too small to be measured in bulk. Prior to this, the ease of measuring radioactive decay energies with a calorimeter was thought possibly likely to allow measurement of changes in mass difference, as a check on Einstein's equation itself. Einstein mentions in his 1905 paper that mass-energy equivalence might perhaps be tested with radioactive decay, which releases enough energy (the quantitative amount known roughly by 1905) to possibly be "weighed," when missing from the system (having been given off as heat). However, radioactivity seemed to proceed at its own unalterable (and quite slow, for radioactives known then) pace, and even when simple nuclear reactions became possible using proton bombardment, the idea that these great amounts of usable energy could be liberated at will with any practicality, proved difficult to substantiate. It had been used as the basis of much speculation, causing Rutherford himself to later reject his ideas of 1904; he was reported in 1933 to have said that: "Anyone who expects a source of power from the transformation of the atom is talking moonshine." [#f56]_

This situation changed dramatically in 1932 with the discovery of the :index:`neutron` and its mass, allowing mass differences for single nuclides and their reactions to be calculated directly, and compared with the sum of masses for the particles that made up their composition. In 1933, the energy released from the reaction of :index:`lithium-7 plus protons` giving rise to 2 alpha particles (as noted above by Rutherford), allowed Einstein's equation to be tested to an error of ±0.5%. However, scientists still did not see such reactions as a source of power.

After the very public demonstration of huge energies released from nuclear fission after the atomic bombings of :index:`Hiroshima` and :index:`Nagasaki` in 1945, the equation |E=mc²| became directly linked in the public eye with the power and peril of nuclear weapons. The equation was featured as early as page 2 of the :index:`Smyth Report`, the official 1945 release by the US government on the development of the atomic bomb, and by 1946 the equation was linked closely enough with Einstein's work that the cover of :index:`Time magazine` prominently featured a picture of Einstein next to an image of a mushroom cloud emblazoned with the equation. [#f57]_ Einstein himself had only a minor role in the :index:`Manhattan Project`: he had cosigned a letter to the U.S. President in 1939 urging funding for research into atomic energy, warning that an atomic bomb was theoretically possible. The letter persuaded :index:`Roosevelt` to devote a significant portion of the wartime budget to atomic research. Without a security clearance, Einstein's only scientific contribution was an analysis of an isotope separation method in theoretical terms. It was inconsequential, on account of Einstein not being given sufficient information (for security reasons) to fully work on the problem. [#f58]_

   :align: center
   :scale: 100 %

   The popular connection between Einstein, |E=mc²|, and the atomic bomb was prominently indicated on the cover of Time magazine in July 1946 by the writing of the equation on the mushroom cloud itself.

While |E=mc²| is useful for understanding the amount of energy potentially released in a fission reaction, it was not strictly necessary to develop the weapon, once the fission process was known, and its energy measured at 200 MeV (which was directly possible, using a quantitative :index:`Geiger counter`, at that time). As the physicist and :index:`Manhattan Project` participant :index:`Robert Serber` put it: "Somehow the popular notion took hold long ago that Einstein's theory of relativity, in particular his famous equation |E=mc²|, plays some essential role in the theory of fission. Albert Einstein had a part in alerting the :index:`United States government` to the possibility of building an atomic bomb, but his theory of relativity is not required in discussing fission. The theory of fission is what physicists call a non-relativistic theory, meaning that relativistic effects are too small to affect the dynamics of the fission process significantly." [#f59]_ However the association between |E=mc²| and nuclear energy has since stuck, and because of this association, and its simple expression of the ideas of Albert Einstein himself, it has become "the world's most famous equation". [#f60]_

While Serber's view of the strict lack of need to use mass-energy equivalence in designing the atomic bomb is correct, it does not take into account the pivotal role which this relationship played in making the fundamental leap to the initial hypothesis that large atoms were energetically *allowed* to split into approximately equal parts (before this energy was in fact measured). In late 1938, while on the winter walk on which they solved the meaning of Hahn's experimental results and introduced the idea that would be called atomic fission, :index:`Lise Meitner` and :index:`Otto Robert Frisch` made direct use of Einstein's equation to help them understand the quantitative energetics of the reaction which overcame the "surface tension-like" forces holding the nucleus together, and allowed the fission fragments to separate to a configuration from which their charges could force them into an energetic "fission". To do this, they made use of "packing fraction", or nuclear binding energy values for elements, which Meitner had memorized. These, together with use of |E=mc²| allowed them to realize on the spot that the basic fission process was energetically possible:

   ...We walked up and down in the snow, I on skis and she on foot. ...and gradually the idea took shape... explained by :index:`Bohr`'s idea that the nucleus is like a liquid drop; such a drop might elongate and divide itself... We knew there were strong forces that would resist, ..just as surface tension. But nuclei differed from ordinary drops. At this point we both sat down on a tree trunk and started to calculate on scraps of paper. ...the Uranium nucleus might indeed be a ginger kid, ready to divide itself... But, ...when the two drops separated they would be driven apart by electrical repulsion, about 200 MeV in all. Fortunately Lise Meitner remembered how to compute the masses of nuclei... and worked out that the two nuclei formed... would be lighter by about one-fifth the mass of a proton. Now whenever mass disappears energy is created, according to Einstein's formula |E=mc²|, and... the mass was just equivalent to 200 MeV; it all fitted! [#f61]_
