Mass-velocity relationship
==========================

In developing :index:`special relativity`, Einstein found that the kinetic energy of a moving body is

.. math::

   E_k = m_0(\gamma-1)c^2 = \frac{m_0 c^2}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} - {m_0 c^2},

with |v| the velocity, :math:`m_0` the rest mass, and γ the Lorentz factor.

He included the second term on the right to make sure that for small velocities, the energy would be the same as in :index:`classical mechanics`:

.. math::

   E_k = \frac{1}{2} m_0 v^2 + \cdots.

Without this second term, there would be an additional contribution in the energy when the particle is not moving.

Einstein found that the :index:`total momentum` of a moving particle is:

.. math::

   P = \frac{m_0 v}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}.

and it is this quantity which is conserved in collisions. The ratio of the momentum to the velocity is the :index:`relativistic mass`, |m|:

.. math::

   m = \frac{m_0}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}

and the relativistic mass and the :index:`relativistic kinetic` energy are related by the formula:

.. math::

   E_k = {m c^2} - {m_0 c^2}.

Einstein wanted to omit the unnatural second term on the right-hand side, whose only purpose is to make the energy at rest zero, and to declare that the particle has a total energy which obeys:

.. math::

   E = mc^2

which is a sum of the :index:`rest energy` :math:`m_0 c^2` and the :index:`kinetic energy`. This :index:`total energy` is mathematically more elegant, and fits better with the momentum in relativity. But to come to this conclusion, Einstein needed to think carefully about collisions. This expression for the energy implied that matter at rest has a huge amount of energy, and it is not clear whether this energy is physically real, or just a mathematical artifact with no physical meaning.

In a collision process where all the rest-masses are the same at the beginning as at the end, either expression for the energy is conserved. The two expressions only differ by a constant which is the same at the beginning and at the end of the collision. Still, by analyzing the situation where particles are thrown off a heavy central particle, it is easy to see that the inertia of the central particle is reduced by the total energy emitted. This allowed Einstein to conclude that the inertia of a heavy particle is increased or diminished according to the energy it absorbs or emits.

Relativistic mass
=================

After Einstein first made his proposal, it became clear that the word mass can have two different meanings. The :index:`rest mass` is what Einstein called m, but others defined the relativistic mass with an explicit index:

.. math::

   m_{rel} = \frac{m_0}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}.

This mass is the ratio of momentum to velocity, and it is also the relativistic energy divided by |c²| (it is not :index:`Lorentz-invariant`, in contrast to :math:`m_0`). The equation :math:`E = {m_{rel} c^2}` holds for moving objects. When the velocity is small, the relativistic mass and the rest mass are almost exactly the same. |E=mc²| either means :math:`E = {m_0 c^2}` for an object at rest, or :math:`E = {m_{rel} c^2}` when the object is moving.

Also Einstein (following :index:`Hendrik Lorentz` and :index:`Max Abraham`) used velocity—and direction-dependent mass concepts (longitudinal and transverse mass) in his 1905 electrodynamics paper and in another paper in 1906. [#f25]_ [#f26]_ However, in his first paper on |E=mc²| (1905), he treated |m| as what would now be called the rest mass. [#f01]_ Some claim that (in later years) he did not like the idea of "relativistic mass." [#f27]_ When modern physicists say "mass", they are usually talking about rest mass, since if they meant "relativistic mass", they would just say "energy".

Considerable debate has ensued over the use of the concept "relativistic mass" and the connection of "mass" in relativity to "mass" in :index:`Newtonian dynamics`. For example, one view is that only rest mass is a viable concept and is a property of the particle; while relativistic mass is a conglomeration of particle properties and properties of spacetime. A perspective that avoids this debate, due to :index:`Kjell Vøyenli`, is that the Newtonian concept of mass as a particle property and the relativistic concept of mass have to be viewed as embedded in their own theories and as having no precise connection.

Low-speed expansion
===================

We can rewrite the expression :math:`E = {\gamma m_0 c^2}` as a :index:`Taylor series`:

.. math::

   E = {m_0 c^2}\left[1
     + \frac{1}{2}  \left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^2
     + \frac{3}{8}  \left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^4
     + \frac{5}{16} \left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^6
     + \cdots \right].

For speeds much smaller than the speed of light, higher-order terms in this expression get smaller and smaller because :math:`v/c` is small. For low speeds we can ignore all but the first two terms:

.. math::

   E \approx {m_0 c^2} + {\frac{1}{2} m_0 v^2}.

The total energy is a sum of the rest energy and the :index:`Newtonian kinetic energy`.

The classical energy equation ignores both the :math:`m_0 c^2` part, and the high-speed corrections. This is appropriate, because all the high-order corrections are small. Since only changes in energy affect the behavior of objects, whether we include the :math:`m_0 c^2` part makes no difference, since it is constant. For the same reason, it is possible to subtract the rest energy from the total energy in relativity. By considering the emission of energy in different frames, Einstein could show that the rest energy has a real physical meaning.

The higher-order terms are extra correction to Newtonian mechanics which become important at higher speeds. The Newtonian equation is only a :index:`low-speed approximation`, but an extraordinarily good one. All of the calculations used in putting astronauts on the moon, for example, could have been done using Newton's equations without any of the higher-order corrections.
