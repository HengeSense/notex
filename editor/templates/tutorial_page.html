    <p>This tutorial helps you to familiarize yourself with the user interface of NoTex and guides you through your first reStructuredText project. The first section is about the <em>user interface</em> and explains the corresponding functionality. The impatient reader can skip it and continue directly with the <em>first project</em> section.</p>

    <h2>User Interface</h2>

    <p>The user interface is split into four areas: On the left the <em>report manager</em> (with its own toolbar), in the central area either the NoTex <em>menu</em> (including this tutorial page) or the <em>editor</em> (not visible yet) and in the header the <em>main toolbar</em> on top of the central area; the footer contains the <em>status bar</em>.</p>

    <h3>Report Manager</h3>

    <p>On the left hand side, you should see the <em>report manager</em>; if you don't, then it is possibly hidden and you have to un-hide it by clicking the small arrow button in the middle of the vertical separator. The same arrow button serves also to hide the report manager. The report (aka project) manager allows you to group various files into projects.</p>

    <h4>Toolbar</h4>

    <p>The report manager's <em>toolbar</em> allows you to create, read, update and delete the reports. You can import and export them and you can open local files to be imported into the currently selected report.</p>

    <h3>Editor</h3>

    <p>In the central area where you read this tutorial, you'll be editing your files inside an <em>editor</em>. It is not visible at the moment, since you've not opened any file yet. So to check out the editor, first open NoTex in a second tab by clicking the following link:</p>

    <ul><li><a href target="_blank">NoTex Editor</a>.</li></ul>

    <p>Continue applying the instructions in the second tab, while reading the tutorial in the first one. Now, click in the manager on the small plus sign of e.g. <em>Complex Article</em>; you can also double click the report icon or title: It will fetch the required data and display a list of associated files.</p>

    <p>They come in three kinds: CFG, TXT and JPG. The <em>option.cfg</em> file is a configuration describing what kind of project you're working with. It is generated by a wizard, which we'll soon have a look at; the <em>content.txt</em> file contains the actual corpus and the other files are JPEG images.</p>

    <p>Click on <em>content.txt</em> to open it. The editor will cover the central area, which means that you've to continue reading this tutorial in the first tab. You should now be looking at a Wikipedia article about <em>mass–energy equivalence</em>, which has been for demonstration purposed copied and reformatted as <em>reStructuredText</em>.</p>

    <h4>Toolbar</h4>

    <p>The editor supports syntax highlighting and many of the standard interactions you're probably familiar with from other text processors. But this one has a <em>toolbar</em> which specifically supports reStructuredText. That means, if e.g. you don't know how to strongly emphasize a couple of words with the reStructuredText markup, then you can simply select and mark the words and click the icon with the capital "B"; the words will be surrounded with asterisks which is the restructured way of telling that you want to strongly emphasize those words.</p>

    <p>Do it: Go ahead and select e.g. the first occurrence of <em>mass–energy equivalence</em> and press the strong emphasis button. The result should be something like <b><tt>**mass–energy equivalence**</tt></b>. Using the editor's toolbar you can learn the reStructuredText markup interactively since the meanings of all the icons on the toolbar are generally known from other applications or are self-descriptive: If you hover over a button you should see a tip box appearing.</p>

    <p>Close the editor by clicking in the footer the "x" button next to the title of the current document <em>content.txt</em>.</p>

    <h3>Main Toolbar</h3>

    <p>The <em>main toolbar</em> offers the same functions as the report manager's toolbar, but each icon has a description label next to it.</p>

    <h3>Status Bar</h3>

    <p>The <em>status bar</em> shows what NoTex is doing at the moment and it allows you also to set the general font size of the editor; if there is not editor open yet, then you won't see any reaction. Otherwise, it also displays the cursor's current line and position; if you click on that information, then the number of lines, words and characters is shown.</p>

    <h2>First Project</h2>

    <p>In the main toolbar click on the small arrow next to the <em>Add</em> button, and select from the drop down menu the <em>Report</em> entry. The <em>Create Report</em> wizard should appear: Enter <em>Tutorial</em> for the project name and your own name for author(s). Skip all the other values, but the last one: Select for content <em>tutorial</em> (instead of <em>empty</em>) and click the <em>Create</em> button.</p>

    <p>A new <em>Tutorial</em> project should be created. In the report manager open the corresponding <em>content.txt</em> file: You should see now an example reStructuredText markup explaining .. well reStructuredText! You can read it later.</p>

    <p>Now, just hit the <em>Export as .. PDF</em> button, and NoTex should deliver in a few seconds a PDF version for the current project; congratulations! You can also experiment with exporting as LaTex or HTML. Or you could do a simple export and re-import the project back into NoTex.</p>

    <h2>What now?</h2>

    <p>Read the just exported PDF (or <a href="{% url editor:rest %}">here</a> as HTML) to learn more about reStructuredText; check out also the other example projects and experiment with the various export possibilities. There is also a <a href="https://github.com/hsk81/notex/wiki" target="_blank">wiki</a> where you can learn more about the <em>option.cfg</em> and <em>content.txt</em> files plus ask questions and provide feedback.</p>
