    <p>NoTex is a browser based editor, which allows you to write  reports and theses based  on the <em>re-structured text</em> markup language. Once written the documents can be exported as PDF, HTML or LaTex.</p>

    <p>If you feel ‒ for various reasons ‒ uncomfortable using an <em>online</em> editor, then you may be interested in an <em>offline</em> solution, which can be used with or even without an internet connection.</p>

    <h2>Download</h2>

    <p>The offline editor is packaged as a so called virtual machine for <em>VirtualBox</em>; based on your needs, you can choose from one of the following two options:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://download.notex.ch/notex.current.intl.ova">NoTex International</a> [ca. 1.1G]</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Offers full support for the LaTex backend <em>Texlive 2012</em>, whereas the far eastern Chinese, Japanese and Korean languages are included. Plus it contains fonts for various other Asian languages. A list of supported packages can be found <a target="_blank" href="http://download.notex.ch/notex.current.intl.txt">here</a>.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://download.notex.ch/notex.current.ncjk.ova">NoTex non-CJK</a> [ca. 635M]</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This non-CJK edition lacks support for Chinese, Japanese and Korean; plus many Asian fonts have been omitted. The list of supported and omitted packages can be found <a target="_blank" href="http://download.notex.ch/notex.current.ncjk.txt">here</a>.</p>

    <p>In addition to one of the above virtual machines, <em>VirtualBox</em> itself is required to run the system; it can found at:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">https://www.virtualbox.org</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Go to the corresponding download section, and choose the version compatible with your operating system. Once VirtualBox is properly setup, you may continue with the installation of NoTex.</p>

    <h2>Installation</h2>

    <p>After you've setup VirtualBox, you have to import the international or the non-CJK version; from the menu of the main window choose:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>&raquo; File &raquo; Import Appliance ...</li>
    </ul>

    <p>and follow the instructions of the import wizard. Once the import is done, start the virtual machine.</p>

    <h2>Usage</h2>

    <p>As soon as the NoTex virtual machine is running, point your browser of choice (not Internet Explorer) to the address:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a target="_blank" href="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080/</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you run the editor on a different host than the browser, then you may have to replace <em>localhost</em> with the correct host name.</p>
